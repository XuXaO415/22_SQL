DDL – Data Definition Language
DQl – Data Query Language
DML – Data Manipulation Language
DCL – Data Control Language

1.DDL(Data Definition Language) : DDL or Data Definition Language actually consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema. 
It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure of database objects in the database.

Examples of DDL commands: 

CREATE – is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function, views, store procedure and triggers).
DROP – is used to delete objects from the database.
ALTER-is used to alter the structure of the database.
TRUNCATE–is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed.
COMMENT –is used to add comments to the data dictionary.
RENAME –is used to rename an object existing in the database.

2.DQL (Data Query Language) :

DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects. The purpose of the DQL Command is to get some schema relation based on the query passed to it. 

Example of DQL: 

SELECT – is used to retrieve data from the database.

3.DML(Data Manipulation Language): The SQL commands that deals with the manipulation of data present in the database belong to DML or Data Manipulation Language and this includes most of the SQL statements. 

Examples of DML: 

INSERT – is used to insert data into a table.
UPDATE – is used to update existing data within a table.
DELETE – is used to delete records from a database table.

4.DCL(Data Control Language): DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deal with the rights, permissions and other controls of the database system. 

Examples of DCL commands: 

GRANT-gives users access privileges to the database.
REVOKE-withdraw user’s access privileges given by using the GRANT command.
TCL(transaction Control Language): TCL commands deal with the transaction within the database. 

Examples of TCL commands: 

COMMIT– commits a Transaction.
ROLLBACK– rollbacks a transaction in case of any error occurs.
SAVEPOINT–sets a savepoint within a transaction.
SET TRANSACTION–specify characteristics for the transaction.

To create a db, use createdb delete_me (name data base whatever you like)
\l - lists all the dbs on your system

To create a db
blahblahblah=# CREATE DATABASE kitty_toys_db;
CREATE DATABASE
blahblahblah=# \l
Shows db list
kitty_toys_db   | blahblahblah | 

To drop a db:
blahblahblah=# DROP DATABASE kitty_toys_db;

\c name_of_your_db - connects to a db

Inspecting tables in PostgreSQL
\dt - lists tables in the db
\d+ name_of_your_table_in_your_current_db - list the column's name & type in a specific table 

Creating tables
ex: This example shows the storing of multiple books and is a collection of data being stored

CREATE TABLE books (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    author TEXT,
    price FLOAT,
    page_count INTEGER,
    publisher TEXT,
    publication_date DATE
);


Column Data Types
Data-types:
-bool
-dates
-int
-float
-text
-varchar (string limits amount of characters)
-serial (used usually for primary key 'id')
-There's a lot more -- see PostgreSQL documentation @ https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html
