Introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL).
-- SQL is is a computer language used for storing, manipulating and retrieving data stored in a relational management database system (RMDS).--

DDL – Data Definition Language
DQl – Data Query Language
DML – Data Manipulation Language
DCL – Data Control Language

1.DDL(Data Definition Language) : DDL or Data Definition Language actually consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema. 
It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure of database objects in the database.

Examples of DDL commands: 

CREATE – is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function, views, store procedure and triggers).
DROP – is used to delete objects from the database.
ALTER-is used to alter the structure of the database.
TRUNCATE–is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed.
COMMENT –is used to add comments to the data dictionary.
RENAME –is used to rename an object existing in the database.

2.DQL (Data Query Language) :

DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects. The purpose of the DQL Command is to get some schema relation based on the query passed to it. 

Example of DQL: 

SELECT – is used to retrieve data from the database.

3.DML(Data Manipulation Language): The SQL commands that deals with the manipulation of data present in the database belong to DML or Data Manipulation Language and this includes most of the SQL statements. 

Examples of DML: 

INSERT – is used to insert data into a table.
UPDATE – is used to update existing data within a table.
DELETE – is used to delete records from a database table.

4.DCL(Data Control Language): DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deal with the rights, permissions and other controls of the database system. 

Examples of DCL commands: 

GRANT-gives users access privileges to the database.
REVOKE-withdraw user’s access privileges given by using the GRANT command.
TCL(transaction Control Language): TCL commands deal with the transaction within the database. 

Examples of TCL commands: 

COMMIT– commits a Transaction.
ROLLBACK– rollbacks a transaction in case of any error occurs.
SAVEPOINT–sets a savepoint within a transaction.
SET TRANSACTION–specify characteristics for the transaction.

To create a db, use createdb delete_me (name data base whatever you like)
\l - lists all the dbs on your system

To create a db
blahblahblah=# CREATE DATABASE kitty_toys_db;
CREATE DATABASE
blahblahblah=# \l
Shows db list
kitty_toys_db   | blahblahblah | 

To drop a db:
blahblahblah=# DROP DATABASE kitty_toys_db;

\c name_of_your_db - connects to a db

Inspecting tables in PostgreSQL
\dt - lists tables in the db
\d+ name_of_your_table_in_your_current_db - list the column's name & type in a specific table 

Creating tables
ex: This example shows the storing of multiple books and is a collection of data being stored

CREATE TABLE books (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    author TEXT,
    price FLOAT,
    page_count INTEGER,
    publisher TEXT,
    publication_date DATE
);


Column Data Types
Data-types:
-bool
-dates
-int
-float
-text
-varchar (string limits amount of characters)
-serial (used usually for primary key 'id')
-There's a lot more -- see PostgreSQL documentation @ https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html

NULL - is a special value in SQL for "unknown"
It's not the same thing as 0 or an empty string

Constraints - are a basic form of validation. 
The database can prevent basic types of unintended behavior
    -Primary key (every table must have a unique identifier)
    -Unique (prevent duplicates in the column)
    -Not Null (prevent null in the column)
    -Check (do a logical condition b4 inserting / updating)
    -Foreign Key (Column values must reference values in another table)
    

Serial - creates a default value that will increment

Primary Key - Whatever column it's corresponding to must be unique
and must be required, IT CANNOT BE NULL
-It is equivalent to just writing UNIQUE, NOT NULL
-It designates a unique identifier column for your table

CASCADE -
It is used in conjunction with ON DELETE or ON UPDATE. It means that the child data is either deleted or updated when the parent data is deleted or updated.

SET NULL
It is used in conjunction with ON DELETE or ON UPDATE. It means that the child data is set to NULL when the parent data is deleted or updated.

SET DEFAULT
It is used in conjunction with ON DELETE or ON UPDATE. It means that the child data is set to their default values when the parent data is deleted or updated.


DELETE ON CASCADE 
ON DELETE CASCADE - It specifies that the child data is deleted when the parent data is deleted.
ON DELETE
ON DELETE SET NULL

Column Manipulation
Adding/ Removing / Renaming columns

example:
ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN in_paperback BOOLEAN;

ALTER TABLE books DROP COLUMN in_paperback;

ALTER TABLE books RENAME COLUMN page_count TO num_pages;


-Normalization - DB design technique which organizes tables in a manner that reduces redundancy and dependency of data
-Divides larger tables to smaller tables and links them using relationships


Indexing - 
A database index is a special data structure that efficiently stores column values to speed up row retrieval via SELECT and WHERE (i.e "read") queries
-speed up row retrieval
-Index efficiency:
    -very fast at looking things up, O(lg(N)) instead of O(N)
    -reduce iterations/ memory impact
    -only add index to a column that you will be looking up rows based off of (like a username)


Indexing is part of DDL, but indexes can be created or dropped at any time.
The more records in the database at the time of creating, the slower the indexing process will be.


CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name(column_name);


CREATE INDEX subreddit_name_index ON subreddits (name);
\d subreddit_name_index #will show indexes (and references)

DROP INDEX subreddit_name_index;
